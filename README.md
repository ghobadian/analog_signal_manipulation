# Voice Signal Processing


## Overview

This project involves working with audio signals. The main tasks are to read, process, and play back audio signals using Python.

## Files

- `voice1.wav`: The input audio file.

## Key Concepts

1. **Linear PCM (Pulse Code Modulation)**:
    - Standard method for encoding audio signals.

2. **Non-Linear PCM (A-law and μ-law)**:
    - Companding algorithms used in telephony and audio compression.

3. **Delta Modulation**:
    - A method of encoding analog signals.

## Questions to Consider

- What is the effect of different companding algorithms on the audio quality?
- How does delta modulation compare to other methods in terms of data compression?
- What are the trade-offs between different sampling rates?
